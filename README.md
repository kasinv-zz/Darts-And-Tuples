# Darts-And-Tuples

In this game, players throw small arrows called darts at a circular board
which is fixed on the wall. Depending on where a dart lands on the dartboard, a certain number of
points is awarded. 

Walk a pikachu around the image looking for other pokemon. This is a type of simple
simulation. Set the parameters of the simulation by asking the user for the number
of turns, to run the simulation (starting at turn 1), the name, of your pikachu and
how often, we run into another pokemon.
